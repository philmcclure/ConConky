ConConky is a very simple system monitor for GNU/Linux virtual console.

It can only display (in the upper right corner of the console) the values of the system time, uptime, load average and memory usage.

It does not require the configuration file and is completely configurable through the command line.

ConConky is distributed under the GNU/GPLv3 (or later) software license.

Because of its primitive has a few advantages:

* A small memory footprint
* Ease of use
* It depends only on libc

Despite its primitiveness has several advantages:

* Looks good
* Looks especially good with midnight commander

This software is, in all likelihood, abandonware.  I did not author it and I have no plans to maintain it.

It *does*, however, still work, and I see no reason for it to disappear from the net.

ConConky is still in the Arch repos, although it points to the now defunct ConConky website.  I suspect it's also available in Debian.

My aim here is for ConConky to at least have a home with more bandwidth than my residential connection can provide in the hopes that one of the distros grabs a copy and maintains it, or at least mirrors it in their repos.
